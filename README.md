# Best Practices (feel free to add if anything comes to you)

Code for readability 

Commit code when it makes sense (don't sit on a mountain of local code)

# How do I get setup?

After downloading gitscm ( or not if you're using a mac ), navigate to the folder you want our project to be located in on your computer.

Run the command: git clone https://github.com/jamesonn/team2Capstone.git

This will pull everything down locally and create the .git folder

Once you've downloaded Android Studio, open a new project; target folder would be MKESocial

You should be able to successfully build, if not you may need to update your tools. You won't need to change any of the skeleton code.
